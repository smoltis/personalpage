No matter how powerful individual computers become, there are still reasons to harness the power of multiple computational units, often spread across large geographic areas.

I'm a big fan of distributed data systems and parallel computing. I was inspired by TPL (Task Parallel Library in .NET when doing my C# programming courses. That helped me understand the idea of MapReduce and many other prominent methods in the world of Big Data.

I've dealt with:
* Spark
* Hadoop
* MapReduce
* Task-based Asynchronous Programming
* In-Memory Distributed Data Grids
* R Server
* tensorflow and keras on GPU
