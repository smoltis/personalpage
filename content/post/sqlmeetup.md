I'm a speaker at The Sydney SQL Server User Group. It is a group for Database IT Professionals 
who are interested in the Microsoft SQL Server technology stack and related technologies.
<!--more-->

The group meets monthly and covers topics from the following tracks.

* DBA: Database Administration

> The DBA track covers topics that are primarily of interest to the Database Administrator 
such as SQL Server architecture and internals, disaster recovery, high-availability, 
hardware, performance optimization, troubleshooting and administration.

* DBD: Database Development

> The DBD track is for the Database Developer and covers areas such as database design 
and optimization, indexing, concurrency, Transact-SQL, coding patterns / practices 
and query optimization.

* ARC: Architecture

> The ARC track is designed to address the needs of Solution / Enterprise Architects. 
This track is more concerned with solution design, architecture patterns and best practises, 
scalability, SQL Server technologies, and aligning your business with Microsoft's strategy / vision.

We aim to deliver sessions that are of a higher calibre than paid-for events such as Microsoft TechEd/Ignite. 
The sessions are technically deep, applicable to your work and full of "lessons from the field". 
You should walk away from a session with a better understanding of the technology and how it can be applied 
in your organization.
